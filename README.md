Raspberry Pi Python program to monitor laser cutter 
 
Objectives: 1) To control the blast gate in line with the laser cutter exhaust vent. 2) To monitor the temperatures in the vent and in the case of the laser cutter. 3) To monitor the use of the laser cutter. 
 
This project is highly hardware dependent. It runs on a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to a 4x80 character LCD and a 9 key switch matrix. It also connects to a servo which controls a blast gate in line with the laser cutter exhaust vent. A small 5 volt power supply is used to monitor when the laser cutter is on or off.
